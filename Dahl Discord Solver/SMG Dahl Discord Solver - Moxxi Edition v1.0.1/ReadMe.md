## Discord Solver (Moxxi Version)
 
In their early days in their making of weapons, Dahl, in collaboration with Torgue created the Discord Solver, a SMG who shot GyroJet explosive bullet. 
 
Unfortunately, the agreement between the two weapons manufacturers did not last long, and the production of the SMG stopped quickly -How ironic for a weapon that's named Discord Solver!- and Torgue seized the patents to create the Pocket Rocket.

It would seem that Moxxi still has a specimen of the Discord Solver in her private Signature collection of weapons, but no one has ever seen it, not even Marcus ... so maybe it's just a legend after all?

Anyway, remnant of the past, a *"lost"* Discord Solver (probably dropped by a bandit?) can still be found... submerged in a shallow pool in Frostburn Canyon.

This is where you can find it...

## What special with this weapon?

- Keep (almost) of all his Unique weapon specificity: very high firerate, variable burst-fire round, shot two bullets for the cost of one ammo, etc... for more details, see [Borderlands Wiki](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Lascaux)  
- Initial damage reduced by 20%, but...
  - FireMode modified to shoot GyroJet Explosive bullet. 
  - Shot two GyroJet explosive bullet for the cost of one ammo (can be doubled if you use the Aaron00000's "Double Anarchy" mod).
  - Impact Explosion boosted by Grenade Damage.  
- As usual for the Vanilla Moxxi weapons, this Moxxi SMG will give you the benefice of:
  - 70% Critical hit bonus
  - 2.5% lifesteal on damage dealt.

### Changelog:

- v1.0.0, September 8, 2018
  - Initial public release
- v1.0.1, September 15, 2018  
  - Added Fix for Orudeon's "Bayonet Enhancements" (Bayonet in slot 2) + Bayonet Buff
 
### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with [UCP Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Community%20Patch%20Team)

- Should be compatible with most other mods, as long as they do not modify the Pocket Rocket Firing Mode.

- Just be aware from the following: 

  - To be sure to get the fix Orudeon's Bayonet Enhancements and/or Orudeon's Bayonet Buff working correctly (as intended), don't forget to place my mod **AFTER** Orudeon's Bayonet Enhancements & Bayonet Buff. 
  
  - This Mod **KEEP** the specific burst from the Lascaux, so if you use the Bandit Brand Tweaks v1.2 by Orudeon, there is a option that reduce the burst to five-shot bursts.  To get back the specific burst, just open your Orudeon's Bandit Brand Tweaks folder, go to: *SMG/Burst Count/* (if you use the Gears Overhaul Orudeon's Mod v1.35, the path will be: *Brands Tweaks/Bandit Brand Tweaks v1.2 by Orudeon/SMG/Burst Count/*) and uncheck the following line:  
```
[ ] set GD_Weap_SMG.Barrel.SMG_Barrel_Bandit_Lascaux ZoomWeaponAttributeEffects ((AttributeToModify = AttributeDefinition'D_Attributes.Weapon.WeaponAutomaticBurstCount',ModifierType = MT_PreAdd,BaseModifierValue = (BaseValueConstant = 1.000000, BaseValueAttribute = None, InitializationDefinition = None, BaseValueScaleConstant = 1.000000)))
``` 
  - This mod use the Pocket Rocket Firing Mode, so if you use any mode that changes the attributes from the Pocket Rocket, it will affect this mod, and obviously the firing of the Discord Solver. In this case, Just revert the modification done previously to the Pocket Rocket.
  
  - This mode use Grenade Damage for the Splash Format, so if you are going to use the Discord Solver with a Siren character :warning: Maya :warning: , don't forget to toggle the Grenade Damage to Reaper Splash Damage.
  
### Troubleshooting:

If a option or a fix don't work as intended, it's not because the Mod is not well coded, but probably (read: in 90% of cases) because this option is overwritten by another mod.

#### What's go wrong?

It's simply because 2 commands work on the same parameter, and one is overwritten by the other.

Better to explain that with a exemple, isn't?

Let's take 2 of my mods:

1.  The *Double Quest Rewards*, which give the choice between 2 *Kiss of Death* given by Moxxi for the mission *Hell Hath No Fury*.  
 
2. The option in *SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition*, which give the choice betwen 2 *SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition* given by Moxxi for the mission *Hell Hath No Fury*. 

You activate the option to have the choice between 2 *SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition* given by Moxxi for the mission *Hell Hath No Fury*, but you still receive the choice from 2 *Kiss of Death* instead of the choice beteen 2 *SMG Dahl Discord Solver* as desired.

Left picture: The mod *SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition* is placed **BEFORE** the Mod *Double Quest Rewards*, and the option which give the choice betwen 2 *SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition* appear in *Dark Green*, that's mean, that another bunch of code overwrite this command (in this case the choice from 2 *Kiss of Death* from the Mod *Double Quest Rewards*)... and yes, that's don't work.

Right picture: To fix this overwriting problem and get the code working as intended, the mod *SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition* must be moved **AFTER** *Double Quest Rewards*. Once done, the reward will appear in *Light Green*, meaning that the code will work correctly, and you will have the choice betwen 2 *SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition* for the mission *Hell Hath No Fury*
![Fix or option not working as intended](https://i.imgur.com/a0eZEVB.png "Don't worry guys... even if my screen capture show French text, my mods are in English")
To summarize: Dark Green = don't work (is overwritten) / Light Green = work (overwrite)... by moving the mod at the end of your patch, the problem will be solved.  

### Other Recommended Mods:

A great mod to check for the Discord Solver Moxxi version:

- [No More Moxxi Lifesteal v2.0](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Akathris/NoMoreMoxxiLifestealv2.0.txt) by [Akathris](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Akathris) . His Mod is self explanatory: removes lifesteal from Moxxi weapons and changes it to passive health regeneration.

- [Double Anarchy v4](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Aaron0000/Weapon-Item%20Parts%20and%20Accessories/DoubleAnarchyv4.txt) by [Aaron00000](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Aaron0000) : Changes the SMGs accuracy accessory into the Double Accessory from Borderlands 1... and your Discord Solver will shot 4 bullets/projectiles at the cost on 2 ammo.   
  
### To do:

- [ ] Show the Explosive icon on the weapon card (it's just cosmetic but I cannot find "how to" now)
- [ ] Change the black parts of the weapon into a "brushed gold" color, for a look more Creamer style (it's just cosmetic but I have no idea how to do it)
- [ ] Make (again) a new playthrough to be sure that all work correctly.
- [ ] Clean the code and remove all my ~~shitty~~ notes.
