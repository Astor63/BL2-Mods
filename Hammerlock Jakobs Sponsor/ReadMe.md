_**Note:** As for my Double Quest Reward "Redux", this Mod will give you the choice between 2 weapons/items instead of a single one, so it will double the chance to get a weapon/item with desired parts._	

### Changelog:

v1.0.0, September 2, 2018
 - Initial public release
 
v1.0.1, September 5, 2018

- [ ] Make (again) a new playthrough to be sure that all the rewards are given correctly.
