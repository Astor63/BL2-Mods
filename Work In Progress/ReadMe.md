## WIP -Work In Progress

You are on my WIP repository, where you can have a preview all my upcoming Mods for Borderlands 2.  

As the name say it, the mods are **==NOT==** totally finished, so obviously, **the Mod won't work correctly**... and by *it won't work correctly*,I mean that the Mod can even break your game.

So please be patient, and wait his release.
