This Read Me is just here as a quick synopsis, for detailed informations, each Mod has is own Read Me (and even a Changelog), so don't hesitate -whoosh!- to give a look on it.

## WIP - Work In Progress

You are on my WIP repository, where you can have a preview all my upcoming Mods for Borderlands 2.

As the name say it, the mods are **NOT** totally finished, so obviously, **the Mod won't work correctly**... and by *it won't work correctly*,I mean that the Mod can even break your game.

So please be patient, and wait his release.

## Quests Improvement:

- __Less Tedious Quest:__ makes a few timed __-failable!-__ optional mission less tedious, but still a little bit challenging, to complete by increasing the countdown time by 50% (x1.5) or 100% (x2).

- __Double Quests Rewards Redux:__ Give you the choice between 2 Unique weapons/items instead of a single one, so it will double the chance to get a Unique weapon/item with desired element/part/accessory.
