## SMG Hyperion Splish Splash - Stendhal Edition

To help keep them competitive in a world that demands element-matching, Hyperion ~~hired~~ corrupted a top-notch research & development team from Maliwan to create a experimental bullet: the SEAMB (Smart Elemental Adaptive Maliwan Bullet) which was capable of adapt itself to whichever type of resistance the enemy had.

Short time after, they created the *SMG Splish Splash - Stendhal Edition*: a SMG able to fire SEAMB (Smart Elemental Adaptive Maliwan Bullet). 

Unfortunately, the mastery of the Elemental technology was in its infancy, and especially very expensive, making the price of sale of this weapons totally prohibitive, and therefore unavailable to the majority of bandits, which involved the production stoppage of this revolutionary SMG only after a few (rare) copies sold.

### Where to find it?

The *SMG Hyperion Splish Splash - Stendhal Edition* can be a drop from Assassin Wot fought during the side mission *Assassinate the Assassins* (Southpaw Steam & Power)... and can also drop from (the same) Assassin Wot at the end of the *A History of Simulated Violence* mission (Digistruct Peak).

**Note:** If you are too lazy to fight Assassin Wot, The *SMG Splish Splash - Stendhal Edition* can become the reward given by Hyperion for the mission *Uncle Teddy* in Arid Nexus - Badlands.... or you can use the Gibbed Codes that you will find below.

### What special with this weapon?

- Fire SEAMB (Smart Elemental Adaptive Maliwan Bullet) a elemental explosive bullet which adapt his Elemental Splash following the kind of impact:
  - Incendiary on flesh
  - Shock on shield
  - Corrosive on armor
  - Explosive on anything else.
- Elemental splash damage boosted by grenade.
- Elemental effect damage improved by 33%, element chance by a small amount, but base damage lowered by 32% to compensate.
- Shot one SEAMB for the cost of 2 ammos (can be doubled if you use the Aaron00000's "Double Anarchy" mod).
- Cosmetic:
  - MuzzleFlash upgraded to Maliwan Bullet.
  - E-Tech Elemental Color Glow.
  - Firing Mode Sound upgraded to Maliwan bullet sound.
  
Not clear? ... Well, perhaps it will be more easy to compare the difference in a table:

- 100% compatible with [UCP Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Community%20Patch%20Team).
- Should be compatible with most other mods, as long as they do not modify the *Tinderbox/Hornet/Twister Firing Mode*.
- Just be aware from the following:
  - This mod use the following Firing Mode: Tinderbox/Hornet/Twister, so if you use any mod wich changes the attributes from any of these Firing Mode, it will affect this mod, and obviously the Firing Mode of the *SMG Hyperion Splish Splash*. In this case, just revert the modification done previously to these Firing Mode.
  - This mod use Grenade Damage for the Splash Format, so if you are going to use the *SMG Hyperion Splish Splash* with a Siren character :warning: Maya :warning: , don't forget to toggle the Grenade Damage to Reaper Splash Damage.
  - This Mod as a option which make the *SMG Hyperion Splish Splash* becoming the reward given by Hyperion for the mission *Uncle Teddy*  in Arid Nexus - Badlands, so be sure that you place this mod **AFTER** my mod *Double Quest Reward Redux* or any other mod modifying the Quest Reward.
