## Less Tedious Quests

As the title suggests it, makes a few timed __-failable!-__ optional mission less tedious, but still a little bit challenging, to complete by increasing the countdown time by 50% (x1.5) or 100% (x2) on the following missions:

- __Borderlands 2: Main Game__
  - Arms Dealing (The Highlands)
  - Customer Service (Eridium Blight)
  - Neither Rain Nor Sleet Nor Skags (Three Horns - Valley)
- __DLC 1 - Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty__
  - Faster Than the Speed of Love (Wurmwater)
- __DLC 2 - Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage__
  - Appetite for Destruction (Torgue Arena)
    - Round 1
    - Round 2
    - Round 3
    - Round 3 Rematch
  - Bar Room Blitz (Pyro Pete's Bar)
    - Round 1
    - Round 2
    - Round 3
    - Round 3 Rematch
  - The Death Race (Badass Crater of Badassitude)
    - Race 1
    - Race 2
    - Race 3
    - Race 3 Rematch
  - Twelve O'Clock High Battle (The Forge)
    - Round 1
    - Round 2
    - Round 3
    - Round 3 Rematch 

Note: I don't make any mission untimed, because it's already done in the great [Darkhell's Quest Fixes](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/FromDarkHell/Quest%20Changes/QuestFix.txt) Mod.

### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with [UCP Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Community%20Patch%20Team)
- Should be compatible with most other mods, as long as they do not touch the Quests.

### Help! The Mod doesn't work !?!

Read this little [Compatibility & Troubleshooting](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Astor/Compatibility%20%26%20Troubleshooting) page... It's not that hard!  :wink:

### Other Recommended Mods:

There's a few things which I'd considered adding to this mod, but were already well-covered in the [QuestFix](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/FromDarkHell/Quest%20Changes/QuestFix.txt) by [FromDarkHell](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/FromDarkHell), so instead I'll just mention it here.

### Changelog:

- v1.0.0, December 7, 2018
  - Initial public release
 
### To do:

- [ ] Clean the code and remove all my ~~shitty~~ notes.
- [ ] Erase this to-do list.

### Credits & Thanks:

I find a lot of useful informations on the Resource page from the [Wiki](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/wiki) of course, but also all the Mission Names and Mission Objectives on the [Resources page](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/FromDarkHell/Resources) from [FromDarkHell](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/FromDarkHell), so thanks for your work, @FromDarkHell
