## Finesse (Commerce & Moxxi Version)

In their early days in their making of weapons, Hyperion, seized Alien Technology plans and created the Finesse: a Plasma Caster who fire SEAPP (Smart Elemental Adaptive Plasma Projectile). 

Unfortunately, the mastery of this Alien technology was in its infancy, and atrociously expensive, which made the price of sale of these weapons totally prohibitive, and therefore unavailable to the majority of bandits, which involved the production stoppage of this revolutionary Plasma Caster only after a few (rare) copies sold.


It would seem that Moxxi still has a specimen of the Finesse in her private Signature collection of weapons, but no one has ever seen it, not even Marcus ... so maybe it's just a legend after all?

## What special with this weapon?

- Both Version:
  - Use SEAPP (Smart Elemental Adaptive Plasma Projectile): a Alien Plasma Projectile which adapt his Elemental following the impact:
    - Incendiary on flesh
    - Shock on shield
    - Corrosive on armor
  - Splash damage booster by grenade  
- Moxxi Version:
  - As usual for the Vanilla Moxxi weapons, this Moxxi SMG will give you the benefice of:
    - 95% Critical hit bonus 
	- 2.5% lifesteal on damage dealt
  
Not clear? ... Well, perhaps it will be more easy to compare the difference in a table:

**Note:** As the Finesse can be found submerged in a shallow pool in a cave, it's make sense to me to keep his Vanilla "Commerce" skin (similar to the Commerce cave paintings), but the Moxxi version, she get a ~~vivid red~~ ... gorgeous Moxxi Signature skin.

This Mod has few options & fix, so feel free to use the BLCMM tool to select the best option that suit you.

... and few fix:

  - Fix for Koby "Rarity Color Fix": Unique or Moxxi (just in case if you use this old mod)

![Finesse as reward for Moxxi mission](https://i.imgur.com/8JPt8ap.png "Don't worry guys... even if my screen capture show French text, my mods are in English") 

**Note:** You can toggle between the choice from 2 Moxxi Finesse or between the choice from 1 Moxxi Finesse & 1 Kiss of Death. 

### Troubleshooting:

If a option or a fix don't work as intended, it's not because the Mod is not well coded, but probably (read: in 90% of cases) because this option is overwritten by another mod.

#### What's go wrong?

It's simply because 2 commands work on the same parameter, and one is overwritten by the other.

Better to explain that with a exemple, isn't?

Let's take 2 of my mods:

1.  The *Double Quest Rewards*, which give the choice between 2 *Kiss of Death* given by Moxxi for the mission *Hell Hath No Fury*.  
 
2. The option in *SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition*, which give the choice betwen 2 *SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition* given by Moxxi for the mission *Hell Hath No Fury*. 

You activate the option to have the choice between 2 *SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition* given by Moxxi for the mission *Hell Hath No Fury*, but you still receive the choice from 2 *Kiss of Death* instead of the choice beteen 2 *SMG Dahl Discord Solver* as desired.

Left picture: The mod *SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition* is placed **BEFORE** the Mod *Double Quest Rewards*, and the option which give the choice betwen 2 *SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition* appear in *Dark Green*, that's mean, that another bunch of code overwrite this command (in this case the choice from 2 *Kiss of Death* from the Mod *Double Quest Rewards*)... and yes, that's don't work.

Right picture: To fix this overwriting problem and get the code working as intended, the mod *SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition* must be moved **AFTER** *Double Quest Rewards*. Once done, the reward will appear in *Light Green*, meaning that the code will work correctly, and you will have the choice betwen 2 *SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition* for the mission *Hell Hath No Fury*
![Fix or option not working as intended](https://i.imgur.com/a0eZEVB.png "Don't worry guys... even if my screen capture show French text, my mods are in English")
To summarize: Dark Green = don't work (is overwritten) / Light Green = work (overwrite)... by moving the mod at the end of your patch, the problem will be solved.

### Other Recommended Mods:

A great mod to check for the Discord Solver:

- Moxxi Version: [No More Moxxi Lifesteal v2.0](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Akathris/NoMoreMoxxiLifestealv2.0.txt) by [Akathris](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Akathris) . His Mod is self explanatory: removes lifesteal from Moxxi weapons and changes it to passive health regeneration.

- Both Version: [Double Anarchy v4](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Aaron0000/Weapon-Item%20Parts%20and%20Accessories/DoubleAnarchyv4.txt) by [Aaron00000](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Aaron0000) : Changes the SMGs accuracy accessory into the Double Accessory from Borderlands 1... and your Discord Solver will shot 4 bullets/projectiles at the cost on 2 ammo.

### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with UCP 4.1
- Just be aware from the following: 
      - This mode use Grenade Damage for the Splash Format, so if you are going to use the Discord Solver with a Siren character :warning: Maya :warning: , don't forget to toggle the Grenade Damage to Reaper Splash Damage.
