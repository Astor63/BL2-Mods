## Finesse (Commerce & Moxxi Version)

In their early days in their making of weapons, Hyperion, seized Alien Technology plans and created the Finesse: a Plasma Caster who fire SEAPP (Smart Elemental Adaptive Plasma Projectile). 

Unfortunately, the mastery of this Alien technology was in its infancy, and atrociously expensive, which made the price of sale of these weapons totally prohibitive, and therefore unavailable to the majority of bandits, which involved the production stoppage of this revolutionary Plasma Caster only after a few (rare) copies sold.


It would seem that Moxxi still has a specimen of the Finesse in her private Signature collection of weapons, but no one has ever seen it, not even Marcus ... so maybe it's just a legend after all?

## What special with this weapon?

- Both Version:
  - Use SEAPP (Smart Elemental Adaptive Plasma Projectile): a Alien Plasma Projectile which adapt his Elemental following the impact:
    - Incendiary on flesh
    - Shock on shield
    - Corrosive on armor
  - Splash damage booster by grenade  
- Moxxi Version:
  - As usual for the Vanilla Moxxi weapons, this Moxxi SMG will give you the benefice of:
    - 95% Critical hit bonus 
	- 2.5% lifesteal on damage dealt
  
Not clear? ... Well, perhaps it will be more easy to compare the difference in a table:

### Other Recommended Mods:

A great mod to check for the Discord Solver:

- Moxxi Version: [No More Moxxi Lifesteal v2.0](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Akathris/NoMoreMoxxiLifestealv2.0.txt) by [Akathris](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Akathris) . His Mod is self explanatory: removes lifesteal from Moxxi weapons and changes it to passive health regeneration.

- Both Version: [Double Anarchy v4](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Aaron0000/Weapon-Item%20Parts%20and%20Accessories/DoubleAnarchyv4.txt) by [Aaron00000](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Aaron0000) : Changes the SMGs accuracy accessory into the Double Accessory from Borderlands 1... and your Finesse will shot 2 Smart Elemental Adaptive Plasma Projectile at the cost on 4 ammos, and will have a chance to be doubled and shot 4 SEAPP at the ridiculous cost on 4 ammo.

### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with UCP 4.1
- Should be compatible with most other mods, as long as they do not modify the Commerce Firing Mode.
- Just be aware from the following: 
  - This mode use Grenade Damage for the Splash Format, so if you are going to use the Discord Solver with a Siren character :warning: Maya :warning: , don't forget to toggle the Grenade Damage to Reaper Splash Damage.
