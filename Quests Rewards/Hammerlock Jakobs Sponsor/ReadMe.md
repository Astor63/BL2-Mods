## Hammerlock Jakobs Sponsor

- ### Borderlands 2 - Main Game:	
  - The 10 missions given by Hammerlock in the main game are rewarded with a Jakobs weapon/item
    
__Note:__ In the Mission Bad Hair Day (Southern Shelf) the Hammerlock reward is now a Blue Sniper Jakobs or a Blue Shotgun Torgue (if the fur is given to Clap-Trap).

- ###Campaign DLC:	
  - __DLC Campaign 1:__ The single mission given by Hammerlock in *Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty* is rewarded with a Jakobs weapon/item
  - __DLC Campaign 3:__ The 4 missions given by Hammerlock in *Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt* are rewarded with a Jakobs weapon/item

*__Note:__ As for my Double Quest Reward "Redux", this Mod will give you the choice between 2 weapons/items instead of a single one, so it will double the chance to get a weapon/item with desired accessory/parts.*

### Help! The Mod doesn't work !?!

Read this little [Compatibility & Troubleshooting](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Astor/Compatibility%20%26%20Troubleshooting) page... It's not that hard!  :wink:

### To do:

- [x] Check twice if I don't forget a Hammerlock mission somewhere (again).
- [x] Clean the code and remove all my ~~shitty~~ notes.
- [ ] Make (again) a new playthrough to be sure that all the rewards are given correctly.
