## SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition
 
In their early days in their making of weapons, Dahl, in collaboration with Torgue created the Discord Solver, a SMG which shot GyroJet explosive bullet. 
 
Unfortunately, the agreement between the two weapons manufacturers did not last long, and the production of the SMG stopped quickly -How ironic for a weapon that's named Discord Solver!- and Torgue seized the patents to create the Pocket Rocket.

It would seem that Moxxi still has a specimen of the Discord Solver in her private Signature collection of weapons, but no one has ever seen it, not even Marcus ... so maybe it's just a legend after all?

Anyway, remnant of the past, a *"lost"* Discord Solver (probably dropped by a bandit?) can still be found... submerged in a shallow pool in Frostburn Canyon.

This is where you can find it...

### What special with this weapon?
- Keep (almost) of all the Lascaux Unique Dahl SMG specificity: very high firerate, variable burst-fire round, chance to shot two bullets for the cost of one ammo, etc... for more details, see [Borderlands Wiki](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Lascaux) 
  - Initial (too good) accuracy reduced, slower fireate, and slower reload, but...
    - FireMode modified to shoot the *Pistol GyroJet Explosive Bullet*. 
    - The speed from the GyroJet Explosive bullet is 5x faster when fired by a SMG than a pistol (but it's still a lot more slower than a normal bullet fired by a SMG) 
    - Chance to shot two GyroJet explosive bullet simultaneously for the cost of one ammo (can be doubled if you use the Aaron00000's "Double Anarchy" mod).
    - Impact Explosion boosted by Grenade Damage.
- Cosmetic:
  - MuzzleFlash upgraded to Explosive Bullet.
  - Explosive Elemental Color Glow (similar to Torgue weapons)
  - Firing Mode Sound upgraded to GyroJet bullet sound.
- As usual for the Vanilla Moxxi weapons, this Moxxi SMG will give you the benefice of:
    - 70% Critical hit bonus
    - 2.5% lifesteal on damage dealt
    - A greater chance to get a extra bullet free 
	
Not clear? ... Well, perhaps it will be more easy to compare the difference in a table:

**Note:** You can toggle between the choice from 2 *Discord Solver Moxxi Edition* or between the choice from 1 *Discord Solver Moxxi Edition* & 1 grenade *Kiss of Death*. 

### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with [UCP Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Community%20Patch%20Team)

- Should be compatible with most other mods, as long as they do not modify the *Pistol Explosive GyroJet Bullet*.

- Just be aware from the following:
  - To be sure to get the fix Orudeon's Bayonet Enhancements and/or Orudeon's Bayonet Buff working correctly (as intended), don't forget to place my mod **AFTER** Orudeon's Bayonet Enhancements & Bayonet Buff. 
  - This mod use the *Pistol Explosive GyroJet Bullet*, so if you use any mode that changes the attributes from this Firing Mode, it will affect this mod, and obviously the firing of the *Discord Solver*. In this case, just revert the modification done previously to it.
  - This mode use Grenade Damage for the Splash Format, so if you are going to use the Discord Solver with a Siren character :warning: Maya :warning: , don't forget to toggle the Grenade Damage to Reaper Splash Damage.
  - This Mod as a option which make the *Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition* becoming the reward given by Moxxi for the mission *Hell Hath No Fury* in Opportunity, so be sure that you place this mod **AFTER** my mod *Double Quest Reward Redux* or any other mod modifying the Quest Reward.
  - This Mod as a option which make the *Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition* becoming the reward given by Moxxi for the *Magic Slaughter Round 5* in *Murderlin's Temple* Arena (*Flamerock Refuge*), so be sure that you place this mod **AFTER** my mod *Battle Arena Sponsored* or any other mod modifying the Quest Reward.

### Know Issues:

- This Mod **KEEP** the specific burst from the *Unique SMG Lascaux*, so if you use the *Bandit Brand Tweaks v1.2* by *Orudeon*, there is a option that reduce the burst to five-shot bursts. 
To get back the specific *Lascaux* burst, just open your *Orudeon's Bandit Brand Tweaks* folder, go to: *SMG/Burst Count/* (if you use the Gears Overhaul Orudeon's Mod v1.35, the path will be: *Brands Tweaks/Bandit Brand Tweaks v1.2 by Orudeon/SMG/Burst Count/*) and uncheck the following line:  
```
  [ ] set GD_Weap_SMG.Barrel.SMG_Barrel_Bandit_Lascaux ZoomWeaponAttributeEffects ((AttributeToModify = AttributeDefinition'D_Attributes.Weapon.WeaponAutomaticBurstCount',ModifierType = MT_PreAdd,BaseModifierValue = (BaseValueConstant = 1.000000, BaseValueAttribute = None, InitializationDefinition = None, BaseValueScaleConstant = 1.000000)))
``` 
### Help! The Mod doesn't work !?!

- [No More Moxxi Lifesteal v2.0](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Akathris/NoMoreMoxxiLifestealv2.0.txt) by [Akathris](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Akathris). His Mod is self explanatory: removes lifesteal from Moxxi weapons and changes it to passive health regeneration.

- [Plasma Caster Hyperion Finesse - Moxxi Edition](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Astor/Custom%20Gear/Plasma%20Caster%20Hyperion%20Finesse%20-%20Moxxi%20Edition) by... well... [myself](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Astor). A Plasma Caster which fire SEAPP (Smart Elemental Adaptive Plasma Projectile)  adapting his Elemental following the kind of impact.

As this version of the Finesse is a Moxxi weapon, you can choose between 3 Moxxi Signature skin : the Classic skin, the Elegance skin or the Pinky skin.

### To do:
