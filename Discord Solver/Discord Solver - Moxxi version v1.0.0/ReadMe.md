## Discord Solver (Moxxi Version)
 
In their early days in the making of weapons, Dahl, in collaboration with Torgue create the Discord Solver, a SMG who fire explosive bullet. 
Unfortunately, the agreement between the two weapons manufacturers did not last long, and the production of the SMG stopped quickly -How ironic for a weapon that's named Discord Solver!- and Torgue created the Pocket Rocket.

It would seem that Moxxi still has a specimen of the Discord Solver in her private Signature collection of weapons, but no one has ever seen it, not even Marcus ... so maybe it's just a legend after all?

Anyway, remnant of the past, a *"lost"* Discord Solver (probably dropped by a bandit?) can still be found... submerged in a shallow pool in Frostburn Canyon.

This is where you can find it...

## What special with this weapon?

- Shot two explosive bullet for the cost of one bullet (can be doubled if you use the Aaron00000's "Double Anarchy" mod).
- Keep almost all his Unique weapon specificity (very high firerate, variable burst-fire round, etc), but I change the Fire Mode to Explosive bullet... and I add some Grenade Damage too  
- Finally, to balance this "a bit too powerful" submachine gun, I "just" reduce the initial damage and the accuracy too (more powerful weapon, but more missing shot... but not that much)
- As usual for the Vanilla Moxxi weapons, this Moxxi SMG will give you the benefice of 70% Critical hit bonus and 2.5% lifesteal on damage dealt.

**Note:** As this version of the Discord Solver is a Moxxi weapon, she get a ~~vivid red~~ ... gorgeous Moxxi Signature skin.

### Other Recommended Mods:

A great mod to check for the Discord Solver Moxxi version:

- [No More Moxxi Lifesteal v2.0](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Akathris/NoMoreMoxxiLifestealv2.0.txt) by [Akathris](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Akathris) . His Mod is self explanatory: removes lifesteal from Moxxi weapons and changes it to passive health regeneration.

- [Double Anarchy v4](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Aaron0000/Weapon-Item%20Parts%20and%20Accessories/DoubleAnarchyv4.txt) by [Aaron00000](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Aaron0000) : Changes the SMGs accuracy accessory into the Double Accessory from Borderlands 1... and your Discord Solver will shot 4 bullets/projectiles at the cost on 2 ammo.

### Changelog:

v1.0.0, September 8, 2018
 - Initial public release
 
### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with UCP 4.1
- Just be aware from the following: 
  - This Mod **KEEP** the specific burst from the Lascaux, so if you use the Bandit Brand Tweaks v1.2 by Orudeon, there is a option that reduce the burst to five-shot bursts.  To get back the specific burst, just open your Orudeon's Bandit Brand Tweaks folder, go to: *SMG/Burst Count/* (if you use the Gears Overhaul Orudeon's Mod v1.35, the path will be: *Brands Tweaks/Bandit Brand Tweaks v1.2 by Orudeon/SMG/Burst Count/*) and uncheck the following line:  
    - [ ]```set GD_Weap_SMG.Barrel.SMG_Barrel_Bandit_Lascaux ZoomWeaponAttributeEffects``` 
  - This mod use the Pocket Rocket Firing Mode, so if you use any mode that changes the attributes from the Pocket Rocket, it will affect this mod, and obviously the firing of the Discord Solver. In this case, you can toggle the Firing Mode between Pocket Rocket to GyroJet explosive bullet.
  - This mode use Grenade Damage for the Splash Format, so if you are going to use the Discord Solver with a Siren character :warning: Maya :warning: , don't forget to toggle the Grenade Damage to Reaper Splash Damage.
  
### To do:

- [ ] Show the Explosive icon on the weapon card (it's just cosmetic but I cannot find "how to" now)
- [ ] Change the black parts of the weapon into a "brushed gold" color, for a look more Creamer style (it's just cosmetic but I have no idea how to do it)
- [ ] Make (again) a new playthrough to be sure that all work correctly.
- [ ] Clean the code and remove all my ~~shitty~~ notes.
