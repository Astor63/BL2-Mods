## *Landscaper* No Self-Damage

Made the child grenades not inflicting self-damage to fixes the issue of where they would (constantly) put you down. Now, the *Landscaper* becomes viable for *second wind* as you will not automatically go down again from the self-damage.

### Where to find it?

The *Landscaper* can be obtained by completing the mission *Clan War: Zafords vs. Hodunks* and siding with the Hodunks.
