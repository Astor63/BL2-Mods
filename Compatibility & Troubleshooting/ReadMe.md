### Troubleshooting:

If a option or a fix don't work as intended, it's not because the Mod is not well coded, but probably because this code is overwritten by another mod.

### What's go wrong?

It's simply because 2 commands work on the same parameter, and one is overwritten by the other.

Better to explain that with a example, isn't?

Let's take 2 of my mods:

1.  The *Double Quest Rewards*, which give the choice between 2 *Kiss of Death* given by Moxxi for the mission *Hell Hath No Fury*.  
 
2. The option in *SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition*, which give the choice betwen 2 *SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition* given by Moxxi as reward for the mission *Hell Hath No Fury*. 

You activate the option to have the choice between 2 *SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition* given by Moxxi as reward for the mission *Hell Hath No Fury*, but you still receive the choice from 2 *Kiss of Death* instead of the choice between 2 *SMG Dahl Discord Solver* as desired. :cry:

Ah! You noticed that *"given by Moxxi as reward for the mission Hell Hath No Fury"* was present in the 2 mods, so you get the idea. :thought_balloon:

Look on the example with picture below to understand why:

**Left picture:** The mod *SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition* is placed **BEFORE** the Mod *Double Quest Rewards*, and the option which give the choice betwen 2 *SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition* appear in *Dark Green*, that's mean, that another bunch of code overwrite this command (in this case the choice from 2 *Kiss of Death* from the Mod *Double Quest Rewards*)... and yes, that's don't work... but you noticed the big red wrong logo, isn't?

**Right picture:** To fix this overwriting problem and get the code working as intended, the mod *SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition* must be moved **AFTER** *Double Quest Rewards*. Once done, the reward will appear in *Light Green*, meaning that the code will work correctly, and you will have the choice betwen 2 *SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition* for the mission *Hell Hath No Fury*.

### To summarize: 

1. **Correct:**
 - *White* = work (normal set command code)
 - *Blue* = work (hotfix)
 - *Light Green* = work (overwrite)
2. **Incorrect:**
 - *Dark Green* = don't work (is overwritten)... by moving the mod at the end of your patch, the problem will be solved in 90% of cases.

I know that all these informations already are mentionned in the wiki page [Functional Changes from FilterTool to BLCMM](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/wiki/Functional-Changes-from-FilterTool-to-BLCMM), so these additional explanations are just for those who don't get the memo :wink:
