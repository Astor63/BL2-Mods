This Read Me is just here as a quick synopsis, for detailed informations, each Mod has is own Read Me (and even a Changelog), so don't hesitate -whoosh!- to give a look on it.

## [Skin Pack] Moxxi Signature Classic Collection

Did you ever noticed that only the half from the Moxxi gears have almost a nice Moxxi Signature Classic skin... and a half have somewhat totally different... which looks more like Tiny Tina weapon skin than Moxxi weapon skin!

Now with the *Moxxi Signature Classic Collection* based on Creamer/Hear Breaker vanilla skin, there are all uniform to look like an actual manufacturer.

## [Skin Pack] Moxxi Signature Elegance Collection

Inspired from the *Santos*, a well know French jeweler watch... with the color from the golden screws inserted into a (silver) brushed steel bracelet, and the addition from the red similar to the little *Cartier* box... Et voila!

## [Skin Pack] Moxxi Signature Pinky Collection

Like a Barbie girl in a Barbie world, you can now feel the glamor in pink with the *Moxxi Signature Pinky Collection* based on Slow Hand / Good Touch vanilla skin.
