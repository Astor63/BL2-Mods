## Bonjour

I'm Astor, and I apologize in advance for some grammar and/or syntax errors, but my mother tongue is French.

This Read Me is just here as a quick synopsis, for detailed informations, each Mod has is own Read Me (and even a Changelog), so don't hesitate -whoosh!- to give a look on it.

## [Quest Reward] [Double Quest Reward Redux v1.0.3](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Astor/Double%20Quest%20Reward%20Redux)

 - Upgrade the customization skin/head rewards to a Blue weapon/item rewards for 9 missions.
 - Choice between 2 Unique weapons/items instead of a single one, so it will double the chance to get a Unique weapon/item with desired parts.

 ## [New Weapon] [SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Lascaux Version v1.0.0]

 - I noticed that Torgue never made any SMG with explosive bullet... in fact, this kind of machine gun don't exist at all in BL2... After searching a while, I discover that, a -very!- long time ago, Dahl made the Discord Solver, a SMG who fire explosive bullet... and a lost weapon can still be found submerged in a shallow pool in Frostburn Canyon... just waiting that you pick it up!

 ## [New Weapon] [SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Version v1.0.0]

 - Identical as the Lascaux Version (just above), but as usual for the Vanilla Moxxi weapons, this Moxxi SMG will give you the benefice of 70% Critical Hit Bonus and 2.5% lifesteal on damage dealt... and can become the reward given by Moxxi for the mission "Hell Hath No Fury" in Opportunity.
