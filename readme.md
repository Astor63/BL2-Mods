## Bonjour

I'm Astor, and I apologize in advance for some grammar and/or syntax errors, but my mother tongue is French.

You are on BL2-Mods repository, where you can find all my Mods for Borderlands 2. (For the TPS Mods, please go to the TPS-Mods section) 

This Read Me is just here as a quick synopsis, for detailed informations, each Mod has is own Read Me (and even a Changelog), so don't hesitate -whoosh!- to give a look on it.

## [Skin] Moxxi Signature Classic Reskin Pack

- Did you ever noticed that only the half from the Moxxi gears have almost a nice Moxxi Signature Classic skin... and a half have somewhat totally different... which looks more like Tiny Tina weapon skin than Moxxi weapon skin!

Now with the *Moxxi Signature Classic Reskin Pack*, all the skin are uniform.

 ## [New Weapon] Plasma Caster Dahl Prototype SX-1 v1.0.0

The Prototype SX-1 was great and really a powerful and dangerous weapon, except that the plasma ball will only explode when coming in contact with a enemy and the missed shots disintegrate instantly "pschitt" like a damp squib (without exploding!) in a tiny cloud of pink smoke.

 ## [New Weapon] SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Bloody Edition v1.1.0

In their early days in the making of weapons, Dahl, in collaboration with Torgue create the Discord Solver, a SMG who fire explosive bullet. 

Unfortunately, the agreement between the two weapons manufacturers did not last long, and the production of the SMG stopped quickly -How ironic for a weapon that's named Discord Solver!- and Torgue created the Pocket Rocket.

Anyway, remnant of the past, a *"lost"* Discord Solver (probably dropped by a bandit?) can still be found... submerged in a shallow pool in Frostburn Canyon.

 ## [New Weapon] SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition v1.1.0

 It would seem that Moxxi still has a specimen of the Discord Solver in her private Signature collection of weapons, but no one has ever seen it, not even Marcus ... so maybe it's just a legend after all? 
 
 ... or perhaps this weapon can become the reward given by Moxxi for the mission "Hell Hath No Fury" in Opportunity...  Who know?
