The normal battles rounds from the following *Battle Arena* are now fully sponsored by weapons manufacturers... and of course, the reward for the final round is still a Moxxi's weapon.

### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with [UCP Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Community%20Patch%20Team)
- Should be compatible with most other mods, as long as they do not touch the Quest Rewards.
- *Arena Battle Sponsored* was tested -and work nicely!- with:
  - [UCP Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Community%20Patch%20Team)   
  - [Better Loot](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Apocalyptech/BL2%20Better%20Loot%20Mod) & [Cold Dead Hands](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Apocalyptech/BL2%20Cold%20Dead%20Hands) by [Apocalyptech](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Apocalyptech)  

:warning: To be sure to get this mod working correctly (as intended), don't forget to place this mod __AFTER__ *UCP Patch* and *Better Quest* (*Better Loot* & *Cold Dead Hands* can be placed anywhere regarding my mod).

### Know Issue:

If you use [Better Quest](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Hemaxhu/Quest%20Rewards/Better%20Quests) by [Hemaxu](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Hemaxhu) mod, to avoid any conflict and be sure to get this mod working correctly (as intended), activate the *Hemaxu's Better Quest Compatibility Fix* at the end of *Arena Battle Sponsored* mod (which will revert the *RewardItemPools* for the Arena Battle part)

__Note:__ Instead of using the *Hemaxu's Better Quest Compatibility Fix* (which is a hotfix overwriting a previous hotfix) a proper way to revert the *RewardItemPools* in Hemaxu's Better Quest, is to manually uncheck the following lines:
```
  [ ] set GD_Aster_TempleSlaughter.M_TempleSlaughter1 Reward.RewardItemPools 
  [ ] set GD_Aster_TempleSlaughter.M_TempleSlaughter2 Reward.RewardItemPools 
  [ ] set GD_Aster_TempleSlaughter.M_TempleSlaughter3 Reward.RewardItemPools 
  [ ] set GD_Aster_TempleSlaughter.M_TempleSlaughter4 Reward.RewardItemPools

  [ ] set GD_Z2_CreatureSlaughter.M_CreatureSlaughter_1 Reward.RewardItemPools
  [ ] set GD_Z2_CreatureSlaughter.M_CreatureSlaughter_2 Reward.RewardItemPools
  [ ] set GD_Z2_CreatureSlaughter.M_CreatureSlaughter_3 Reward.RewardItemPools
  [ ] set GD_Z2_CreatureSlaughter.M_CreatureSlaughter_4 Reward.RewardItemPools
  [ ] set GD_Z2_CreatureSlaughter.M_CreatureSlaughter_5 Reward.RewardItemPools
  [ ] set GD_Z3_RobotSlaughter.M_RobotSlaughter_1 Reward.RewardItemPools
  [ ] set GD_Z3_RobotSlaughter.M_RobotSlaughter_2 Reward.RewardItemPools
  [ ] set GD_Z3_RobotSlaughter.M_RobotSlaughter_3 Reward.RewardItemPools
  [ ] set GD_Z3_RobotSlaughter.M_RobotSlaughter_4 Reward.RewardItemPools
  [ ] set GD_Z3_RobotSlaughter.M_RobotSlaughter_5 Reward.RewardItemPools 
``` 
... on this way, you will get the same result, but you will avoid 72 hotfixes (36 in *Hemaxu's Better Quest* and 36 in my *Arena Battle Sponsored Compatibility Fix*).

### Help! The Mod doesn't work !?!

Read this little [Compatibility & Troubleshooting](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Astor/Compatibility%20%26%20Troubleshooting) page... It's not that hard!  :wink:

### Other Recommended Mods:

- [Better Quest](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Hemaxhu/Quest%20Rewards/Better%20Quests) by [Hemaxu](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Hemaxhu): His Mod give you weapon/item rewards above 'Green' level up to a Legendary, and does NOT replaces unique rewards.

### Changelog:

- v1.0.0, December 7, 2018
  - Initial public release
- v1.0.1, Decembre 8, 2018
  - Add *Hemaxu's Better Quest Compatibility Fix*  
- v1.0.2, Decembre 10, 2018 
  - Add a toggle option in *Murderlin's Temple* sponsored by *Dahl* to give you the choice between 2 Gemstones weapons (UCP Reward) or 2 Legendary Dahl Weapons (__*Veruc*__ or __*Pitchfork*__)   

### To do:

- [ ] Make (again) a new playthrough to be sure that all the weapon/item rewards are given correctly.
- [ ] Clean the code and remove all my ~~shitty~~ notes.
- [ ] Erase this to-do list.

### Credits & Thanks:
