## Battle Arena Sponsored

The rounds 1-4 from the following *Battle Arena* are now fully sponsored by weapons manufacturers... and of course, the reward for the final round is still a Moxxi's weapon.

### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with [UCP Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Community%20Patch%20Team)
- Should be compatible with most other mods, as long as they do not touch the Quest Rewards.
- *Arena Battle Sponsored* was tested -and work nicely!- with:
  - [UCP Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Community%20Patch%20Team)   
  - [Better Loot](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Apocalyptech/BL2%20Better%20Loot%20Mod) & [Cold Dead Hands](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Apocalyptech/BL2%20Cold%20Dead%20Hands) by [Apocalyptech](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Apocalyptech)  

:warning: To be sure to get this mod working correctly (as intended), don't forget to place this mod __AFTER__ *UCP Patch* and *Better Quest* (*Better Loot* & *Cold Dead Hands* can be placed anywhere regarding my mod).

### Know Issue:

If you use [Better Quest](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Hemaxhu/Quest%20Rewards/Better%20Quests) by [Hemaxu](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Hemaxhu) mod, to avoid any conflict and be sure to get this mod working correctly (as intended), activate the *Hemaxu's Better Quest Compatibility Fix* at the end of *Arena Battle Sponsored* mod (which revert the *RewardItemPools* for the Arena Battle)

### Help! The Mod doesn't work !?!

Read this little [Compatibility & Troubleshooting](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Astor/Compatibility%20%26%20Troubleshooting) page... It's not that hard!  :wink:

### Other Recommended Mods:

- [Better Quest](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Hemaxhu/Quest%20Rewards/Better%20Quests) by [Hemaxu](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Hemaxhu): His Mod give you weapon/item rewards above 'Green' level up to a Legendary, and does NOT replaces unique rewards.

### Changelog:

- v1.0.0, December 7, 2018
  - Initial public release
- v1.0.1, Decembre 8, 2018
  - Add Hyperion sponsor as weapons rewards for the rounds 1-4 and the choice between 2 Moxxi's weapons for the round 5th in *Hyperion Circle Of Slaughter* Arena in *One Chasm* (instead of just the *Chère-Amie* as reward for the 5th round)  

### To do:

- [ ] Make (again) a new playthrough to be sure that all the weapon/item rewards are given correctly.
- [ ] Clean the code and remove all my ~~shitty~~ notes.
- [ ] Erase this to-do list.

### Credits & Thanks:

I find a lot of useful informations on the Resource page from the [Wiki](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/wiki) of course, but also all the Mission Names and Mission Objectives on the [Resources page](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/FromDarkHell/Resources) from [FromDarkHell](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/FromDarkHell), so thanks for your work, @FromDarkHell 

Note: This mod was totally build from scratch, but was (strongly) inspired by the -unfortunately now defunct!- "Double Quest Rewards" Mod initially created by Koby (among many others great Mods), hence the "Redux" in its name.
