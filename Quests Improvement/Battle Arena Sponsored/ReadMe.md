### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with [UCP Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Community%20Patch%20Team)
- Should be compatible with most other mods, as long as they do not touch the Quest Rewards.
- *Arena Battle Sponsored* was tested -and work nicely!- with:
  - [UCP Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Community%20Patch%20Team)   
  - [Better Loot](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Apocalyptech/BL2%20Better%20Loot%20Mod) & [Cold Dead Hands](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Apocalyptech/BL2%20Cold%20Dead%20Hands) by [Apocalyptech](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Apocalyptech)  

:warning: To be sure to get this mod working correctly (as intended), don't forget to place this mod __AFTER__ *UCP Patch* and *Better Quest* (*Better Loot* & *Cold Dead Hands* can be placed anywhere regarding my mod).

### Know Issue:

If you use [Better Quest](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Hemaxhu/Quest%20Rewards/Better%20Quests) by [Hemaxu](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Hemaxhu) mod, to avoid any conflict and be sure to get this mod working correctly (as intended), activate the *Hemaxu's Better Quest Compatibility Fix* at the end of *Arena Battle Sponsored* mod (which revert the *RewardItemPools* for the Arena Battle)

### Help! The Mod doesn't work !?!

Read this little [Compatibility & Troubleshooting](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Astor/Compatibility%20%26%20Troubleshooting) page... It's not that hard!  :wink:

### Other Recommended Mods:

There's a few things which I'd considered adding to this mod, but were already well-covered in other mods, so instead I'll just mention them here:

- [GearboxGunsPlus](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/eca477d33671be540718c816662cb08f4f0ad1cd/Borderlands%202%20mods/Aaron0000/Gear%20Packs/GearboxGunsPlus.txt) by [Aaron00000](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Aaron0000): His Mod spruces up the Gearbox guns (include the ~~crappy pistol~~ Basic Repeater) and changes the rarity of the Gearbox weapons (Assault Rifle, SMG & Sniper Rifle) to Blue.

- [Better Quest](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Hemaxhu/Quest%20Rewards/Better%20Quests) by [Hemaxu](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Hemaxhu): His Mod give you weapon/item rewards above 'Green' level up to a Legendary, and does NOT replaces unique rewards.

### To do:

- [x] Bring back some Unique weapon/Item as mission rewards for the main game.
- [x] Upgrade the customization skin/head rewards to weapon/item rewards for the main game.
- [x] Bring back some Unique weapon/Item as mission rewards for the DLCs.
- [ ] Upgrade the customization skin/head rewards to weapon/item rewards for the DLCs.
- [ ] Make (again) a new playthrough to be sure that all the Unique weapon/item rewards are given correctly.
- [ ] Clean the code and remove all my ~~shitty~~ notes.
- [ ] Erase this to-do list.

So, yes... in the future, more addition will be done in this Mod (who by the way is my first one), but only when I will find some free time, so stay tuned :wink:

### Credits & Thanks:

I find a lot of useful informations on the Resource page from the [Wiki](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/wiki) of course, but also all the Mission Names and Mission Objectives on the [Resources page](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/FromDarkHell/Resources) from [FromDarkHell](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/FromDarkHell), so thanks for your work, @FromDarkHell 

Note: This mod was totally build from scratch, but was (strongly) inspired by the -unfortunately now defunct!- "Double Quest Rewards" Mod initially created by Koby (among many others great Mods), hence the "Redux" in its name.
