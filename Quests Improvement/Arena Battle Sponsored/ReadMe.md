### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with [UCP Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Community%20Patch%20Team)
- Should be compatible with most other mods, as long as they do not touch the Quest Rewards.
- *Arena Battle Sponsored* was tested -and work nicely!- with:
  - [UCP Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Community%20Patch%20Team)   
  - [Better Loot](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Apocalyptech/BL2%20Better%20Loot%20Mod) & [Cold Dead Hands](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Apocalyptech/BL2%20Cold%20Dead%20Hands) by [Apocalyptech](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Apocalyptech)  

:warning: If you use [Better Quest](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Hemaxhu/Quest%20Rewards/Better%20Quests) by [Hemaxu](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Hemaxhu) mod, to be sure to get this mod working correctly (as intended), activate the *Hemaxu's Better Quest* Fix at the end of *Arena Battle Sponsored* mod, __AND__ don't forget to place this mod __AFTER__ *UCP Patch* and *Better Quest* (*Better Loot* & *Cold Dead Hands* can be placed anywhere regarding my mod).

### Help! The Mod doesn't work !?!

Read this little [Compatibility & Troubleshooting](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Astor/Compatibility%20%26%20Troubleshooting) page... It's not that hard!  :wink:

### Other Recommended Mods:

- [Better Quest](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Hemaxhu/Quest%20Rewards/Better%20Quests) by [Hemaxu](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Hemaxhu): His Mod give you weapon/item rewards above 'Green' level up to a Legendary, and does NOT replaces unique rewards.

### Changelog:

- v1.0.0, Decembre 7, 2018
  - Initial public release
 
### To do:

- [ ] Make (again) a new playthrough to be sure that all the Unique weapon/item rewards are given correctly.
- [ ] Clean the code and remove all my ~~shitty~~ notes.
- [ ] Erase this to-do list.

### Credits & Thanks:
