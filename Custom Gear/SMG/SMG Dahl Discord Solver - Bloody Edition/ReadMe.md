## SMG Dahl Discord Solver (Bloody Edition)
 
In their early days in their making of weapons, Dahl, in collaboration with Torgue created the Discord Solver, a SMG who shot GyroJet explosive bullet. 

Unfortunately, the agreement between the two weapons manufacturers did not last long, and the production of the SMG stopped quickly -How ironic for a weapon that's named Discord Solver!- and Torgue seized the patents to create the Pocket Rocket.

Remnant of the past, a *"lost"* Discord Solver (probably dropped by a bandit?) can still be found... submerged in a shallow pool in Frostburn Canyon.

This is where you can find it....

**Note:** If you are too lazy to walk to Frostburn Canyon, you will find the Gibbed Codes below.


### What special with this weapon?

- Keep (almost) of all the Lascaux Unique Dahl SMG specificity: very high firerate, variable burst-fire round, chance to shot two bullets for the cost of one ammo, etc... for more details, see [Borderlands Wiki](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Lascaux) 
- Initial (too good) accuracy reduced, slower fireate, and slower reload, but...
  - FireMode modified to shoot the *Pistol GyroJet Explosive Bullet*. 
  - The speed from the GyroJet Explosive bullet is 5x faster when fired by a SMG than a pistol (but it's still a lot more slower than a normal bullet fired by a SMG) 
  - Chance to shot two GyroJet explosive bullet simultaneously for the cost of one ammo (can be doubled if you use the Aaron00000's "Double Anarchy" mod).
  - Impact Explosion boosted by Grenade Damage.
- Cosmetic: 
    - MuzzleFlash upgraded to Explosive Bullet.
    - Explosive Elemental Color Glow (similar to Torgue weapons)
    - Firing Mode Sound upgraded to GyroJet bullet sound.
	
Not clear? ... Well, perhaps it will be more easy to compare the difference in a table:

To summarize: To compensate the benefit from GyroJet Explosive bonus, the initial base damage is lowered by 20%.

Of course, the weapon skin is grunge... What did you expect for a weapon which stay forgetten in a pool in a cave since a eternity? A pristine and shiny weapon perhaps? Well, no... she is dirty and all rusted! Be happy that this old submachine gun is still able to shot fews bullets!

This Mod has few options, so feel free to use the BLCMM tool to select the best option that suit you.

- The Splash Format has a toggle option between Grenade/Rocket/Reaper (see Compatibility below)
- The Weapon Card has a toggle option between English/French.
- The Bloody skin has a toogle option between:
  - The *Bloody* Skin: Grunge and bloody
  - The *Grunge* Skin: Grunge (without blood)
  - The original Lascaux Skin
- The Elemental Color Glow has a toggle option between:
  - Explosive Elemental Color (similar to  Torgue weapons) 
  - E-Tech Elemental Color (Vanilla)

... and few fix:

- Fix for Orudeon's *Bayonet Enhancements* (Bayonet in slot 2) + Orudeon's *Bayonet Buff*
- Fix for Orudeon's *Bayonet Enhancements* (Bayonet in slot 2)
- Fix for Orudeon's *Bayonet Buff* in Slot 1
- Fix for Koby *Rarity Color*: *AfterMarket* rarity (just in case if you use this old mod)

### Changelog:

- v1.0.0, September 8, 2018
  - Initial public release
- v1.1.0, September 25, 2018  
   - Totally revamp the FireMode
   - Clean the code  
- v1.1.1, October 06, 2018

  - Correct the wrong line of code (was *Set WeaponTypeDefinition'GD_Weap_SMG.A_Weapons...* instead of *Set GD_Weap_SMG.A_Weapons...*) repeated 9 times by using copy/paste to go faster.-     

### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with [UCP Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Community%20Patch%20Team)

- Should be compatible with most other mods, as long as they do not modify the *Pistol Explosive GyroJet Bullet*.

- Just be aware from the following:

  - To be sure to get the fix Orudeon's Bayonet Enhancements and/or Orudeon's Bayonet Buff working correctly (as intended), don't forget to place my mod **AFTER** Orudeon's Bayonet Enhancements & Bayonet Buff. 
 
  - This Mod **KEEP** the specific burst from the Lascaux, so if you use the Bandit Brand Tweaks v1.2 by Orudeon, there is a option that reduce the burst to five-shot bursts.  To get back the specific burst, just open your Orudeon's Bandit Brand Tweaks folder, go to: *SMG/Burst Count/* (if you use the Gears Overhaul Orudeon's Mod v1.35, the path will be: *Brands Tweaks/Bandit Brand Tweaks v1.2 by Orudeon/SMG/Burst Count/*) and uncheck the following line:  
  ```
  [ ] set GD_Weap_SMG.Barrel.SMG_Barrel_Bandit_Lascaux ZoomWeaponAttributeEffects ((AttributeToModify = AttributeDefinition'D_Attributes.Weapon.WeaponAutomaticBurstCount',ModifierType = MT_PreAdd,BaseModifierValue = (BaseValueConstant = 1.000000, BaseValueAttribute = None, InitializationDefinition = None, BaseValueScaleConstant = 1.000000)))
  ``` 
  - This mod use the *Pistol Explosive GyroJet Bullet*, so if you use any mode that changes the attributes from this Firing Mode, it will affect this mod, and obviously the firing of the *Discord Solver*. In this case, just revert the modification done previously to it.
  
  - This mode use Grenade Damage for the Splash Format, so if you are going to use the Discord Solver with a Siren character :warning: Maya :warning: , don't forget to toggle the Grenade Damage to Reaper Splash Damage.

### Help! The Mod doesn't work !?!

Read this little [Compatibility & Troubleshooting](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Astor/Compatibility%20%26%20Troubleshooting) page... It's not that hard!  :wink:
   
### Other Recommended Mods:

A great mod to check for the Discord Solver Bloody Edition:

- [Double Anarchy v4](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Aaron0000/Weapon-Item%20Parts%20and%20Accessories/DoubleAnarchyv4.txt) by [Aaron00000](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Aaron0000) : Changes the SMGs accuracy accessory into the Double Accessory from Borderlands 1... and your Discord Solver will shot 2 GyroJet Explosive bullets at the cost on 2 ammo, and will have a chance to be doubled and shot 4 GyroJet Explosive bullets at the ridiculous cost on 2 ammo.

### To do:

- [x] Make a new ~~nice and shiny~~ grunge and bloody skin.
- [x] Clean the code and remove all my ~~shitty~~ smart notes. 
- [ ] Make (again) few kills to be sure that the submachine gun work correctly.
