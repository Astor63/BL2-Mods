## SMG Dahl Discord Solver (Moxxi Edition)
 
In their early days in their making of weapons, Dahl, in collaboration with Torgue created the Discord Solver, a SMG who shot GyroJet explosive bullet. 
 
Unfortunately, the agreement between the two weapons manufacturers did not last long, and the production of the SMG stopped quickly -How ironic for a weapon that's named Discord Solver!- and Torgue seized the patents to create the Pocket Rocket.

It would seem that Moxxi still has a specimen of the Discord Solver in her private Signature collection of weapons, but no one has ever seen it, not even Marcus ... so maybe it's just a legend after all?

Anyway, remnant of the past, a *"lost"* Discord Solver (probably dropped by a bandit?) can still be found... submerged in a shallow pool in Frostburn Canyon.

This is where you can find it...

## What special with this weapon?
- Keep (almost) of all the Lascaux Unique Dahl SMG specificity: very high firerate, variable burst-fire round, chance to shot two bullets for the cost of one ammo, etc... for more details, see [Borderlands Wiki](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Lascaux) 
  - Initial (too good) accuracy reduced, slower fireate, and slower reload, but...
    - FireMode modified to shoot the Pistol GyroJet Explosive Bullet. 
    - The speed from the GyroJet Explosive bullet is 5x faster when fired by a SMG than a pistol (but it's still a lot more slower than a normal bullet fired by a SMG) 
    - Chance  to shot two GyroJet explosive bullet simultaneously for the cost of one ammo (can be doubled if you use the Aaron00000's "Double Anarchy" mod).
    - Impact Explosion boosted by Grenade Damage.
    - Firing Mode Sound upgraded to GyroJet bullet sound.
    - MuzzleFlash upgraded to Explosive Bullet.
    - Explosive Elemental Color Glow (similar to Torgue weapons)
  - As usual for the Vanilla Moxxi weapons, this Moxxi SMG will give you the benefice of:
    - 70% Critical hit bonus
    - 2.5% lifesteal on damage dealt
    - A greater chance to get a extra bullet free 
	
Not clear? ... Well, perhaps it will be more easy to compare the difference in a table:

### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with [UCP Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Community%20Patch%20Team)

- Should be compatible with most other mods, as long as they do not modify the Pocket Rocket Firing Mode.

- Just be aware from the following:

  - To be sure to get the fix Orudeon's Bayonet Enhancements and/or Orudeon's Bayonet Buff working correctly (as intended), don't forget to place my mod **AFTER** Orudeon's Bayonet Enhancements & Bayonet Buff. 
 
  - This Mod **KEEP** the specific burst from the Lascaux, so if you use the Bandit Brand Tweaks v1.2 by Orudeon, there is a option that reduce the burst to five-shot bursts.  To get back the specific burst, just open your Orudeon's Bandit Brand Tweaks folder, go to: *SMG/Burst Count/* (if you use the Gears Overhaul Orudeon's Mod v1.35, the path will be: *Brands Tweaks/Bandit Brand Tweaks v1.2 by Orudeon/SMG/Burst Count/*) and uncheck the following line:  
  ```
  [ ] set GD_Weap_SMG.Barrel.SMG_Barrel_Bandit_Lascaux ZoomWeaponAttributeEffects ((AttributeToModify = AttributeDefinition'D_Attributes.Weapon.WeaponAutomaticBurstCount',ModifierType = MT_PreAdd,BaseModifierValue = (BaseValueConstant = 1.000000, BaseValueAttribute = None, InitializationDefinition = None, BaseValueScaleConstant = 1.000000)))
  ``` 
  - This mod use the *Pistol GyroJet Firing Mode*, so if you use any mode that changes the attributes from the Pistol GyroJet Firing Mode, it will affect this mod, and obviously the firing of the Discord Solver. In this case, Just revert the modification done previously to the Pistol GyroJet Firing Mode.
  
  - This mode use Grenade Damage for the Splash Format, so if you are going to use the Discord Solver with a Siren character :warning: Maya :warning: , don't forget to toggle the Grenade Damage to Reaper Splash Damage.

### Other Recommended Mods:

A great mod to check for the Discord Solver Moxxi version:

- [No More Moxxi Lifesteal v2.0](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Akathris/NoMoreMoxxiLifestealv2.0.txt) by [Akathris](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Akathris) . His Mod is self explanatory: removes lifesteal from Moxxi weapons and changes it to passive health regeneration.

- [Double Anarchy v4](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Aaron0000/Weapon-Item%20Parts%20and%20Accessories/DoubleAnarchyv4.txt) by [Aaron00000](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Aaron0000) : Changes the SMGs accuracy accessory into the Double Accessory from Borderlands 1... and your Discord Solver will shot 2 GyroJet Explosive bullets at the cost on 2 ammo, and will have a chance to be doubled and shot 4 GyroJet Explosive bullets at the ridiculous cost on 2 ammo.

### To do:

- [x] Change the black parts of the weapon into a "brushed gold" color, for a look more Creamer style (Thanks to PsychoPatate for his help)
- [x] Clean the code and remove all my ~~shitty~~ notes. 
- [ ] Make (again) fews kills to be sure that all work correctly.

### Credits & Thanks:
First of all, I need thanks [PsychoPatate](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/PsychoPatate "PsychoPatate") for his help -and his patience!-  when I was getting nowhere fast (in French: "lorsque je pédalais dans la semoule" :wink:) to realise my 1st *Moxxi Signature Classic* skin; so a big -and special- thanks to you @PsychoPatate.
