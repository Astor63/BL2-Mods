## Plasma Caster Hyperion Finesse - Circuit Board Edition

In their early days in their making of weapons, Hyperion, seized Alien Technology plans and created the Finesse: a Plasma Caster which fire SEAPP (Smart Elemental Adaptive Plasma Projectile). 

Unfortunately, the mastery of this Alien technology was in its infancy, and especially very expensive, which made the price of sale of these weapons totally prohibitive, and therefore unavailable to the majority of bandits, which involved the production stoppage of this revolutionary Plasma Caster only after a few (rare) copies sold.

## Where to find it?

The Plasma Caster Hyperion Finesse can be a drop from Assassin Wot fought during the side mission *Assassinate the Assassins* (Southpaw Steam & Power)... and can also drop from (the same) Assassin Wot at the end of the *A History of Simulated Violence* mission (Digistruct Peak).

**Note:** If you are too lazy to fight Assassin Wot, you will find the Gibbed Codes below.

## What special with this weapon?

- Fire SEAPP (Smart Elemental Adaptive Plasma Projectile) exploding only in contact with a enemy: a Alien Plasma Projectile which adapt his Elemental following the kind of impact:
  - Incendiary on flesh
  - Shock on shield
  - Corrosive on armor
- Elemental splash damage boosted by grenade (only when hitting a enemy).
- Shot one SEAPP for the cost of 2 ammo (can be doubled if you use the Aaron00000's "Double Anarchy" mod).
- Cosmetic:
  - MuzzleFlash upgraded to Plasma Caster.
  - E-Tech Elemental Color Glow ("inside" the flaps).
  - Firing Mode Sound upgraded to Plasma Caster sound.
  
Not clear? ... Well, perhaps it will be more easy to compare the difference in a table:

**Note:** The Circuit Board skins... as its name suggests, looks like a circuit board... and you have the choice between 2 Circuit Board skin: the Blue Circuit Board or the Yellow Circuit Board!

## Options: 
This Mod has few options & fix, so feel free to use the BLCMM tool to select the best option that suit you:

- The Splash Format has a toggle option between Grenade/Rocket/Reaper (see Compatibility below)
- The Weapon Card has a toggle option between English/French.
- The E-Tech Elemental Color Glow has a toggle option between On/Off
- The skin has a toggle option between the Blue Circuit Board/Yellow Circuit Board/Vanilla Commerce Skin
- The *Plasma Caster Finesse- Circuit Board Edition* can become the reward given by Hyperion for the mission *Uncle Teddy*  in Arid Nexus - Badlands. (see picture below) 
- Fix for Koby *Rarity Color*: AfterMarket (just in case if you use this old mod) 

![Finesse as reward for Hyperion mission](https://imgur.com/CeuGBS7.jpg "Don't worry guys... even if my screen capture show French text, my mods are in English") 

**Note:** You can toggle between the choice from 2 *Plasma Caster Finesse- Circuit Board Edition* or between the choice from 1 *Plasma Caster Finesse- Circuit Board Edition* & 1 SMG *Bitch* (Legendary).

## Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with [UCP Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Community%20Patch%20Team).
- Just be aware from the following:
  - This mod use the following Firing Mode: Pocket Rocket/Tinderbox/Hornet/Twister, so if you use any mod wich changes the attributes from any of these Firing Mode, it will affect this mod, and obviously the firing of the Finesse. In this case, just revert the modification done previously to these Firing Mode.
  - This mode use Grenade Damage for the Splash Format, so if you are going to use the Plasma Caster Finesse with a Siren character :warning: Maya :warning: , don't forget to toggle the Grenade Damage to Reaper Splash Damage.
